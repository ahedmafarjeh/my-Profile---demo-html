<p>------ About Me --------</p>
<p>

  My name is Ahed Mafarjeh, and I am 25 years old. I hail from Ramallah, a city that holds a special place in my heart, and I currently reside in Beit Leqya, a peaceful village known for its scenic beauty and close-knit community. 
  
  My educational journey began in my village, where I attended school and developed a strong foundation in academics and community values. Motivated by my passion for technology and problem-solving, I pursued higher education at Birzeit University, where I dedicated myself to studying Computer Engineering. The rigorous coursework and practical experiences at university equipped me with valuable skills in software development, networking, and system architecture.</p>
  <p>
  Beyond academics, I have a diverse range of interests and hobbies that keep me engaged and balanced. I am an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying activities such as football, tennis, and running, which not only keep me physically fit but also foster camaraderie and teamwork. Additionally, I find great satisfaction in hitting the gym regularly, striving to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
  
  One of my greatest passions is programming. The thrill of writing code, solving complex problems, and creating innovative solutions drives me to explore new technologies and stay updated with industry trends. Whether I'm developing applications, troubleshooting software issues, or collaborating with like-minded individuals, programming allows me to channel my creativity and analytical skills into tangible results.
  
  In summary, my journey from Ramallah to Beit Leqya, through school and university, has shaped me into a dedicated Computer Engineering graduate with a deep appreciation for education, technology, and personal growth. I look forward to applying my skills and knowledge to contribute positively to the ever-evolving field of technology and pursue my aspirations with enthusiasm and determination.</p>
